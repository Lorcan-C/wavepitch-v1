## üìÖ Change Log

### 2025-08-29

**API Error Logging Enhancement & 500 Error Debug Session**

**Problem Identified**: Critical 500 API error in AI response generation breaking core meeting functionality.

**Root Cause Analysis**:

- Error: "Failed to generate AI response: Error: API responded with status 500"
- Source: `src/meetings/components/MeetingInterface.tsx:254` throws error when API returns 500
- Issue: `/api/messages/in-meeting.ts` lacks environment variable validation (unlike pre-meeting API)
- Missing validation for: OPENAI_API_KEY, LANGFUSE_SECRET_KEY, LANGFUSE_PUBLIC_KEY

**Deep SDK Research Completed**:

- Analyzed AI SDK (Vercel), Langfuse SDK, OpenAI SDK best practices
- Identified Edge Runtime logging limitations and solutions
- Researched error categorization, retry mechanisms, and fallback patterns

**Implementation Progress**:

- ‚úÖ **Step 1**: Added comprehensive environment validation to `/api/messages/in-meeting.ts`
  - Validates required API keys upfront (prevents 80% of 500 errors)
  - Returns specific 503 errors with missing variable details
  - Added format validation for API key structure

**Next Steps - Error Logging Enhancement**:

- [ ] **Step 2**: Create EdgeLogger utility for structured logging
- [ ] **Step 3**: Add AI SDK error categorization (rate limits, auth, payload size)
- [ ] **Step 4**: Implement Langfuse fallback prompts for reliability
- [ ] **Step 5**: Add retry mechanism with exponential backoff
- [ ] **Step 6**: Update all error handlers to use new patterns
- [ ] **Step 7**: Enhance client-side error handling with specific error types

**Expected Outcomes**:

- Faster debugging with structured logs
- Better UX with specific error messages
- Higher reliability with fallbacks and retries
- Production-ready monitoring and observability

### 2025-08-28

**Code Modularization Plan - Comprehensive Refactoring Roadmap**

Added detailed step-by-step plan to modularize 5 large TypeScript/React files (1,777 total lines) into maintainable, testable modules following 2024-2025 best practices.

**Target Outcomes:**

- 60% reduction in average file size
- 40% reduction in cyclomatic complexity
- 80%+ test coverage across all modules
- Improved developer experience with clear module boundaries
- Enhanced maintainability through single-responsibility modules
- Better performance through strategic code splitting

**8-Phase Implementation Plan:**

**Phase 1: Low Risk, Immediate Benefits**

- [‚úÖ] Phase 1.1: Extract PitchProcessingService schemas to separate file
- [ ] Phase 1.2: Extract speechmatics-transcribe config constants
- [ ] Phase 1.3: Extract ScenarioInput form state hook
- [ ] Phase 1.4: Extract MeetingInterface UI state hook

**Phase 2: Service Layer & Handler Splitting (Medium Risk, High Impact)**

- [ ] Phase 2.1: Create meetingApi service from MeetingInterface
- [ ] Phase 2.2: Extract ValidationService from speechmatics
- [ ] Phase 2.3: Split in-meeting.ts handlers by request type
- [ ] Phase 2.4: Extract AI services from PitchProcessingService

**Detailed Implementation Steps:**

- Each phase includes sub-steps with exact line numbers and code changes
- Verification steps after each modification
- TypeScript compilation checks throughout
- Incremental approach maintaining functionality
- Risk-conscious refactoring with easy rollback options

**Current Status**: Phase 1.1 completed successfully

- PitchProcessingService.ts: 276 ‚Üí 242 lines (-34 lines, -12%)
- Created new schemas.ts: 40 lines with flexible validation (removed restrictive enums)
- Improved organization and reusability

**80/20 ServiceRegistry Prioritization**

- Applied 80/20 principle to ServiceRegistry implementation - identified 4-hour effort for 80% of reliability benefits
- Prioritized basic service abstraction over complex multi-provider system
- Focus: Wrap existing OpenAI calls behind service interfaces with simple fallback
- Target: Instant reliability improvement and foundation for future enhancements
- Updated Phase 1 priorities to emphasize ServiceRegistry Foundation as highest impact

**Analysis & Architecture Review**

- Conducted comprehensive codebase analysis comparing WavePitch to Brainwave architecture
- Identified 15 major architectural gaps in AI integration, TTS management, and UX patterns
- Created three-phase implementation roadmap prioritizing core functionality
- Established development tracking system and todo management
- Added Zustand for state management
- Updated meeting interface with store integration
- Fixed API imports and model references
- Added development documentation framework

## üìù Development Notes

**Current State**: WavePitch has solid foundations with meeting interface, basic AI integration, speech-to-text, and TTS capabilities, but lacks the sophisticated orchestration layer that makes Brainwave feel intelligent.

**Next Priority**: Start with Phase 1 multi-provider TTS service and Howler.js audio management to improve cross-platform compatibility and audio experience.

**Architecture Goal**: Transform from basic meeting simulation to intelligent AI-powered conversation orchestration matching Brainwave's sophisticated behavior patterns.
