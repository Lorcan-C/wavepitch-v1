## üìÖ Change Log

### 2025-08-28

**80/20 ServiceRegistry Prioritization**

- Applied 80/20 principle to ServiceRegistry implementation - identified 4-hour effort for 80% of reliability benefits
- Prioritized basic service abstraction over complex multi-provider system
- Focus: Wrap existing OpenAI calls behind service interfaces with simple fallback
- Target: Instant reliability improvement and foundation for future enhancements
- Updated Phase 1 priorities to emphasize ServiceRegistry Foundation as highest impact

**Analysis & Architecture Review**

- Conducted comprehensive codebase analysis comparing WavePitch to Brainwave architecture
- Identified 15 major architectural gaps in AI integration, TTS management, and UX patterns
- Created three-phase implementation roadmap prioritizing core functionality
- Established development tracking system and todo management
- Added Zustand for state management
- Updated meeting interface with store integration
- Fixed API imports and model references
- Added development documentation framework

## üìù Development Notes

**Current State**: WavePitch has solid foundations with meeting interface, basic AI integration, speech-to-text, and TTS capabilities, but lacks the sophisticated orchestration layer that makes Brainwave feel intelligent.

**Next Priority**: Start with Phase 1 multi-provider TTS service and Howler.js audio management to improve cross-platform compatibility and audio experience.

**Architecture Goal**: Transform from basic meeting simulation to intelligent AI-powered conversation orchestration matching Brainwave's sophisticated behavior patterns.
