## üìù Development Notes

**Current State**: WavePitch has solid foundations with meeting interface, basic AI integration, speech-to-text, and TTS capabilities, but lacks the sophisticated orchestration layer that makes Brainwave feel intelligent.

**Next Priority**: Start with Phase 1 multi-provider TTS service and Howler.js audio management to improve cross-platform compatibility and audio experience.

**Architecture Goal**: Transform from basic meeting simulation to intelligent AI-powered conversation orchestration matching Brainwave's sophisticated behavior patterns.
